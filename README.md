_You wake up standing at the door of a strange house deep in the woods..._

**The Pumpkin Room** is a spooky, text-based & story-driven game that I wrote for my daughters.

## The Guts

### Game Logic: TypeScript

TypeScript handles the core logic of the game, tracking the player's choices, branching the story, and managing game states (e.g., current location, inventory, or character stats). I chose TypeScript to make the codebase more scalable and easier to debug, especially as the game inevitably grows in complexity.

### UI: Angular, Tailwind

Angular provides the modular, component-based architecture for the user interface. I chose Angular for its two-way data binding, which makes it easy to update the game state and reflect changes in the UI. I used Tailwind for easy to manage, flexible, and consistent styling.

### Backend: TBA

Allows saving progress and tracking the number of choices made in a game. Did you find a fast escape? Did you quickly meet your fate? Did you really explore all there is to explore?

### Deployment: TBA

You want to play, don't you?
